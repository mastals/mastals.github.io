<center><h1>The Mastals Story Of How It All Started</h1></center>

<h3>Mastals started when I wanted to be a leader of something.I thought of having a team,so I looked for a name.3 weeks later,I
  came up with Mastals Mast-asters and Als-metals.So then I started building up this site.But before that I had asked my best 
  friends to help me recruit members for Mastals.Then,I started thinking about what kind of team it should be,after a week,I
  came up with this-Fighting-I specialize in it, and engineering.</h3>
